## How do I think about FOSS

I think OSS(Open Source Software) is good thing. If everyone cooperate, we can make grater software.   
Not only program. All of Electronic data. For e.g., Music(such as free downloard and free remis on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com). Music artists say remix. It's means blanch.),Blueprints 3d CAD data(such as  [sketchup 3d warehouse](https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/?hl=en). I thought that If sektch up OSS, it'd be better.) ,free images(such as [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)) & etc.  
I belive we can to be better together whole world if we pulish and make blanch(or remix).
